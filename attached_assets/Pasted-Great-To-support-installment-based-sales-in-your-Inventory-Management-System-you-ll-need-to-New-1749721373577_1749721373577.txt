Great! To support installment-based sales in your Inventory Management System, you‚Äôll need to:
‚úÖ New Feature: Installment Sales Module

This allows a customer to buy a product and pay over time via scheduled installments. Here's how you can integrate this feature:
üîß 1. Database Changes
A. Customers Table (if not already there)

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  address TEXT
);

B. Installment Sales Table

CREATE TABLE installment_sales (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
  product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  down_payment DECIMAL(10,2),
  number_of_installments INTEGER,
  installment_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  start_date DATE,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Active', -- e.g., Active, Completed, Overdue
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

C. Payment Tracking Table

CREATE TABLE installment_payments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  installment_sale_id INTEGER REFERENCES installment_sales(id),
  payment_date DATE,
  amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_method VARCHAR(50),
  remarks TEXT
);

üñ•Ô∏è 2. Frontend UI Additions
‚úÖ Sales Page

    Add a checkbox: ‚òê Buy with Installments

    If selected, show a form:

        Down payment

        Number of installments (e.g., 3, 6, 12 months)

        Auto-calculate installment amount = (total - down payment) / number_of_installments

        Start date (optional)

‚úÖ Installment Form (For Customers)

    Name, Contact, Address

    Product selected

    Down payment

    Installment plan

    Agreement checkbox (‚òê I agree to pay the above in full by the end of the plan)

üìä 3. Monitoring Tab (Admin Side)

Create a new menu/tab: "Installment Monitoring"

Include a table showing:
Customer	Product	Total	Paid	Remaining	Status	Next Due Date	Action

You can use color codes:

    üü¢ Active

    üü° Partial

    üî¥ Overdue

    ‚úÖ Completed

Add filters for:

    Status

    Customer name

    Product name

    Date range

Use libraries like:

    Vue + Vuetify/DataTables

    React + Material UI

    Chart.js for trends (total due, collected, overdue)

üîî 4. Notifications (Optional)

    Auto-reminder SMS/email before due date

    Alert admins of overdue accounts

‚úÖ Optional Extensions

    Attach PDF agreement forms

    Export reports (CSV/PDF)

    Print receipts after each payment

üß© Ready for Code?

Let me know your stack (e.g., Vue + Firebase, or Flask + PostgreSQL) and I‚Äôll generate full code for:

    Installment form

    API for saving & tracking payments

    Admin dashboard with monitoring

Would you like to proceed with a Vue + Flask or Firebase-only version?
